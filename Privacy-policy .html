          <p><strong>9. Risks and how we keep your Personal Information secure</strong></p>
          <p>9.1 The main risk of us processing your Personal Information is if it is lost, stolen or misused. This could lead to your Personal Information being in the hands of someone else who may use it fraudulently or make public, information that you may wish to keep private. </p>
          <p>For this reason, Hunny’s Bunny is committed to protecting your Personal Information from loss, theft and misuse. We take all reasonable precautions to safeguard the confidentiality of your Personal Information, including through use of appropriate organisational and technical measures. For example, all information you provide to us is stored on secure servers and any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology.</p>
          <p>9.2 In the course of the provision of your Personal Information to us, your Personal Information may be transferred over the internet. Although we make every effort to protect the Personal Information which you provide to us, the transmission of information over the internet is not completely secure. You acknowledge and accept that we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information transmitted to our website and that any such transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your Personal Information, we will use strict procedures and security features to prevent unauthorised access to it.</p>
          <p>9.3 Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access your online account, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask that you do not share your password with anyone.</p>
